In March 2016, it beat Lee Sedol in a five-game match, the first time a computer Go program has beaten a 9-dan professional without handicap. Although it lost to Lee Sedol in the fourth game, Lee resigned in the final game, giving a final score of 4 games to 1 in favor of AlphaGo. One of the most notable moments of the match was AlphaGo's unexpected 'move 37' in game two, a move that initially baffled experts but was later recognized as a profoundly creative and strategic play that demonstrated the program's ability to think beyond conventional human strategies.",
